# Release history

## v0.1.2

### Mouse can leave too
`tapend` is getting called to cancel the tap action when mouse is leaving the button.

### Removed touch/click `preventDefault` fix

[WuiDom](https://github.com/Wizcorp/wui-Dom/releases/tag/0.3.3) was refactored and incorporates this fix.
This made a lot more sense as all behaviors would need this.
It didn't make sense to have to replicate this every time we created a new behavior.
As such this version of wui-buttonBehavior requires WuiDom v0.4.0 and above.


## v0.1.0

First version
